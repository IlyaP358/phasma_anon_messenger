# 🕯️ Phasma — Anonymous Web Messenger over Tor

**Phasma** is a next-generation anonymous web messenger focused on **privacy**, **security**, and **freedom of communication**. All traffic is routed through the [Tor network](https://www.torproject.org/), making it extremely difficult to trace or intercept messages.

> ⚠️ This project is in an **early development stage**. Features and UI will evolve rapidly over time.

## 🧱 Key Features (planned / partially implemented)
